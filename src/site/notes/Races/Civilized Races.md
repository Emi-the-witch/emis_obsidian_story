### Humans

### Beastkin

### Elves

### Dragonfolk

Extremely rich and powerful, they live near civilization as a deterrent to prevent war in their city by just being there and get paid in return. They treat every other race as servants. They have two forms, dragon and dragonkin appearances.

### Lamia

They have their own cities and trade with other civilized races but similar to elves, they are very segregationist and don't allow other races to live in their cities. Unlike Elves, they do not restrict themselves to forests
