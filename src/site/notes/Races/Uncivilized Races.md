### Slime 
Humanoid slimes that don't wear clothes and eat plants. They tend to stay out in nature, sometimes befriending Alraune or other plantifolk by eating the 'weeds'.

### Harpies
Although they do have their own cities in the mountains, they rarely associate with other races, defending their territory from interlopers.

## Plantifolk
This group consists of Alraune, Dryad, and Fungifolk

### Alraune
Unable to leave where they are, they are viewed as not part of civilization. They use their pollen to attract prey or simple long distance communication. 

### Dryad
As they are unable to go far from their trees/forests, they are not viewed as part of civilization, even though they are generally peaceful and willing to interact with the [[Races/Civilized Races\|civilized races]].

### Fungifolk
The most mobile of plantifolk, they appear to look like humans with built-in mushroom hats.
