### Rhona Ironheart
Noble Beastkin currently on leave from the military due to unknown reasons. She loves to sight see and spend lavishly but has a violent side that can't be quelled unless she gets it out by well, violence. Highly proficient in magic and uses a great sword that materializes from mana. Her family beg that she act a little bit more with grace and not step on her family name but that isn't who she is. The only reason why she joined the military was to see battle and that was taken away from her briefly.
