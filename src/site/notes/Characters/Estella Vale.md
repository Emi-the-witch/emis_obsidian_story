### Estella Vale

She appears as a young tigerkin [[Races/Beastkin\|Beastkin]] with red hair, green eyes, tiger ears and a tiger tail. Estella is found between the cities of [[Locations/Thane/Elone\|Elone]] and [[Locations/Thane/Jasket\|Jasket]] in [[Locations/Thane/Thane\|Thane]]. 

When [[Characters/Lyra Lumin\|Lyra Lumin]] and [[Characters/Kaida Dellarine Marcella\|Kaida Dellarine Marcella]] discover her, she's wounded and Lyra treats her wounds. As Estella is treated, Lyra, Kaida, and Estella are attacked by a group destroying their carriage and making them run to escape.

Estella has scales on various parts of her body, easily covered up by her clothes, including the base of her tail. 

Estella is actually a mix of tigerkin and [[Races/Dragonkin\|Dragonkin]], and the reason why she's being chased is because [[Locations/Lagrea/Caeloria\|Caelorian]] mercenaries wanted to capture the 'weak [[Races/Dragonkin\|dragonkin]]' to protect their own city with the deterrence of having a dragon in the city. 

After capturing Estella, she managed to break out, but was stabbed in the back to prevent her from escaping.
