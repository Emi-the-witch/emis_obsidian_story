### Lyra Lumin
Lyra Lumin, doctor (and mage) of the town of [[Locations/Thane/Niam\|Niam]]. Lyra was sponsored to go to the magical academy for her training in exchange for being a rural town's doctor for a few years by the country of [[Locations/Thane/Thane\|Thane]]. Lyra moved to [[Locations/Thane/Niam\|Niam]] about a year ago and, for the most part, isn't needed very often and thus enjoys taking walks along the river near her home even during 'work hours'. Her 3 bedroom home doubles as the hospital, with two of the bedrooms being dedicated for possible patients. 

Lyra grew up poor and worked hard to get where she is today. Getting trained to be a mage is extremely expensive, and she'd never have been able to afford it if it wasn't for the country's sponsorship for doctors. Luckily, in this country of Thane, [[Races/Beastkin\|Beastkin]] like her aren't discriminated against, but she still had issues with people wanting to pet her ears or tail without even asking growing up. Lyra is respected in [[Locations/Thane/Niam\|Niam]], although people don't make much of an effort to get to know her, since they just assume she'll leave once her required employment ends, just like everyone else who has had this position. 

Being a doctor is even more rewarding than she thought it'd be, being able to help those in need, but this small town has left her feeling more lonely than she'd expected. It's not as if she'd have denied the opportunity to become a doctor knowing it, but it is still a continuing disappointment.  

Enjoying her newfound ability to pay for basic necessities as a doctor, Lyra is still disappointed by the lack of choices on things to buy in a town of about 300 people. Being the only mage in town, there are no magical crafters for the truly exquisite goods, not that Lyra is used to such things. While she enjoys going out to the few restaurants or the bakery, if she wants any of her favorite meals, she has to make them herself.

Her signature outfit is the only decent quality one she has, and she uses magic to clean and mend it if it manages to tear during her walks. The outfit contains a white blouse, black corset, and a red, knee-length skirt. Lyra is over 6 feet tall, if you measure from her ears, 5' 9" if you don't. She has long blonde hair down to her butt, and her tail could almost make you think her hair reaches down to her ankles if not for the fact her hair is curly and her tail is not.

Lyra is Wolfkin, part of [[Races/Civilized Races#Beastkin\|Beastkin]] race.
