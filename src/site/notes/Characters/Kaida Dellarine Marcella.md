### Kaida Dellarine Marcella
![Kaida_Marcella.webp](/img/user/Characters/Images/Kaida_Marcella.webp)
Kaida Dellarine Marcella is a senior merchant of the renowned enterprise, Zephyr. The business is the largest merchant trade in all of the country of Caeloria. The trade was founded by her father, a former general in the army, and her mother, a high-ranking noble. She has two older brothers and is the youngest in the family and they all live in the capital city of Aeloria. Instead of using her privilege to further her knowledge of magic studies, Kaida opted to go into the family business. With her talent for bargaining, she's known to bend the rules, excelling at trades and business but not to her father and older brother's liking. Even though Kaida has immense respect for her father, she feels as though she is the black sheep of the family due to always being scolded and never living up to her family's expectations. 

She often splurges on fashionable goods and pretty jewels in her free time. Not a day goes by that she doesn't have a lavish meal three times a day. Her friends and family sometimes call her KD, referencing her first and middle name. 

Personality quote: 

_"I can't just have bread! I need butter, cakes, cookies, and the best wine you can find in this rundown place you call an eatery!"_

Kaida's normal work outfit is a brown beret, white sweater wrapped in a brown corzet and a brown travel jacket to keep warm. Along with a brown dress, she changes it up with her sharp black boots. But when she's outside of work, she loves to dress in all kinds of fashionable wears. With all kinds of jewelry and the like. One of her favorite outfits in her white dress, with pink ribbons and red gloves. But she rarely wears that one outside of social gatherings because she doesn't like getting it dirty and the cost of it's cleaning is outrageous even to her.
